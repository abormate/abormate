- 👋  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, acquaintances, and family.
- 💻  I’m a Filipino engineer specializing in the field of Cloud DevOps. Presently, I'm still gradually growing skills & knowledge in order to deliver good value, and be able to help solve some small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. Coffee in the morning, breakfast, and chilled soda to me, sounds very good. And more often than not, I watch goofy doggo videos online (sometimes, a few chonky catto videos put in there, too). ^_^ Who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh?
- 🌱  Abe is committed to learning. Gradually, but continually he up-skills around areas of the Cloud computing -- particularly with areas that allow himself to grow practical engineering skills. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for people.
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find meaningful, stable work to help me gain security. Enable me to help family, and also, to collaborate with others in order to help do some good with what we can do with technology. Working together, with tech as our democratized enabler, I think we can, together, build and create a good tomorrow.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email & send it thru: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Thank you.
