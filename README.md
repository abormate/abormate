- üëã  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to acquaintances, and family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm an aspiring Filipino engineer, with a background in Web Analytics and Organic Search Marketing. Presently, I'm still growing relevant skills & gathering knowledge in order for me to help deliver value for folks who give me a chance. And this means, to be able to help solve some small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. A warm mug of coffee (not piping hot, but warm -- without sugar, please), and a hearty breakfast early in the morning -- sounds very good to me also.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy but goodest doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, chonky catto videos put in there, too). ^_^ Now, who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh?
- No. Sorry, I don't play much videogames anymore. Unlike when I was much younger. Now I mostly just listen to a mix of videogame music soundtrack with other types of music as I work or study. I'm fascinated with wide-purpose computer programming (please note -- I'm not an expert -- but I do know how to write simple logic with code in order to solve problems, and can do a few things with it).
- Learning doesn't stop. Regardless what field your line of work happens to revolve in. I think no matter what kind of job we do for a living -- we'll need to embrace continual learning and somehow find ways to self-educate. Books and online courses are your bestfriends, in the requirement of learning. Right now, I'm still learning also. And with this said -- learning about machines in general is to my interest. Such as tutorials from veteran car mechanics around simple maintenance tasks for a small gasoline car engine helps a lot. One that most non-pros like me could still do. And finally, leisurely playing an acoustic guitar -- if time permits -- is relaxing to me. Not much, mostly I find tablatures online. Then I follow these tabs to be able to play a song. If not, strumming across guitar chord progressions that I could recall, match and mix is what I do to pass time. 
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around some areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this with reliability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please, no spam, okay? Thank you!
