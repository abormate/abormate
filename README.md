- 👋  Hello there, how are you doing? My name is Abraham, or Abe to all my friends, co-workers, and family.
- 💻  I’m a Filipino Web Analyst and an engineering-aspirant, a learner. Presently, I'm growing skills in order to deliver value and help solve some technical problems. For me, I like most home-cooked foods (I love food & beverage). More often than not, I watch goofy doggo videos online (and sometimes, also a few catto vids put in there, too). ^_^
- 🌱  Abe is committed to keep learning & gradually but continually to up-skill around Web Analytics & a few other adjacent areas of the Cloud computing -- like DevOps engineering (he's able to set up & maintain reliable infra, implement DevOps with a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment workflow, et cetera).
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find meaningful work to help me gain security, help my family-members, and also, to collaborate with others to do some good with technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email & send it thru: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Thank you.
