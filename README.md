- üëã  Hi there! Hello, my friends! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe (/ah-beh/) to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and at home with family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm a rookie Filipino engineer, aspiring to help others thru small technical contributions done with work. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, Mostly, I'm still a new recruit into engineering proper -- however, and I say with gratitude, that now I'm training to become helpful with some background experience as a web developer in the past. To also add, around the past few years, I worked as an analyst specializing in Web Analytics, before being given a chance to contribute as a rookie engineer.
- Apart from what I help do to earn a living, I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, a lifetime won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. We need God in all things. We need His blessing in everything. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. üêëüïä
- Presently, I'm growing technical skills & learning relevant knowledge in order for me to help deliver value to folks who chose to give me a chance. And for me this means, to be able to help people we serve -- through working together solving problems.
- For me, I love food and drink. A mug of coffee (I like freshly-brewed coffee, from locally-grown coffee beans, with some coffee-creamer or whole milk added to it. Not piping hot, and not cold either -- but warm -- also, without any sugar). A mug of warm coffee, and a hearty breakfast in the morning -- sounds good to me.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy but goodest doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, chonky catto videos put in there, too). Now, who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh? ^_^ Anyway, I do like doggos and we've mostly had doggos as good pets and family members at home. :0)
- Learning as a requirement for anyone, is endless. Regardless what field your line of work happens to revolve in. I think no matter what kind of job we do for a living -- we'll need to embrace continual learning and somehow find a way to learn further. It need not be abrupt or all of a sudden. Proper and effective learning takes time and patience. With this said, good books and online courses with hands-on practice are your bestfriends, in this constant requirement for learning.
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. Gradually but continually, he up-skills with study, practice, and training. Mostly, he's learning around areas of cloud computing. Particularly, with software delivery and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I can't do this alone -- it's always with a cohesive, like-minded team working together -- and helping each other towards a meaningful goal.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please I do say, no spam, okay? Salamat! Thanks!
- And also, my friends, we give the glory to God, with what it is we do. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. I also think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving God. And from what I have learnt, we can do this -- through loving and helping other people, which begins at home -- with our own families -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute.
- Let us ask God to purify our intentions in our work & when we're helping others. To God be the glory. Glory and praise to God.
