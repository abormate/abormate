-- üëã Hi there. Hey! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, please call me kuya Abe ("kuya" is a Filipino word meaning older brother). I'm a Filipino tech worker, with ordinary roots.

-- üíª Folks, my brothers and sisters, please allow me to speak my mind. I'm a Filipino engineer with some work experience working for organizations who employ devops. For these groups of people, I have had the opportunity to help deploy new app versions across a number of steps, or checkpoints if you will, with purpose-built automation at each step. From another side, taking good care of necessary infrastructure that allow these apps to run is part of what our team helps with. And perhaps, a few other stuff relating to "keeping the lights" on. My friends, I still have much room to grow. Like any branch of I.T., or any field if you think about it, from our modern job markets. There is always plenty of stuff to learn. With this, like you, like many of our brothers and sisters, I'm embracing continual learning. We do this, to keep growing and consequently to remain relevant in our job market. You know what it is like, yes? Especially with the advent of new things. We need to keep learning. Like our brothers and sisters who work in this I.T. space or any branch. I'm also on a mission. For me, my mission statement is to serve the Lord our God, through helping people we serve (somehow, we need to go beyond the context of doing it for business reasons) with what we're able to do with computers. Computer I.T. needs to serve this purpose, in order to come full circle. Our collective work grows to become fulfilling if it has a good purpose behind it, beyond just serving oneself. If we work together with the right heart helping others (helping reduce suffering, where we're able). My friends, like you, I want to work a living doing what we're passionate about, while helping contribute to a good cause.

-- üõ£Ô∏è Friends, as we are traveling our shared journey, as fellow-pilgrims on earth, as fellow servants, for us to keep growing, and, to remain capable-enough to help. We must embrace continual learning, self-education. We must find a way to up-skill ourselves, find teachers, while we're working to earn a living for ourselves, for our families and loved-ones.

-- üíûÔ∏è And if it happens, you're someone who's looking to hire more hands to your team. Friend, I‚Äôm looking to find livelihood with what I can help do. Something that, I hope creates good meaning. From out of service, to help and elevate other people around us.

-- üì´ Friends, if you need to talk to me. Please reach out and write me an email. Thanks

-- üåÖ My brothers and sisters, may we offer what we do, and what we say, to bring glory to the Lord our God. It is right. We ought to give God the honor, all thanks-giving, and praise -- with what it is we do, and, with what it is we say. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things. Remember, apart and without God. We are helpless. We cannot do anything on our own. May I speak? I think we are alive for our unifying purpose of loving and serving God. From what I have learned, serving God means loving and helping other people. Which begins inside our homes -- with our families, then to our friends, and then, so on going forward. My friends, let us choose to become a part, no matter how small we are, let us become a part of the healing salve of God.

-- ü§≤üèº Let us check ourselves often. The good Jesuits, call it "examen". A reflection, a conscious effort of looking inside ourselves. Remember, that the best way to change anything -- is not to force, or coerce other people to change their ways or their thinking -- but, it is with looking inside, changing what we can, improving what is inside, that we are able to see changes. We change our old ways, for ourselves, but we also need to improve ourselves for other people around us. Moreso, for the people we love around us. Yes? With this. Let us always ask the Lord our God, Christ Jesus our Lord and good Shepherd, and the Holy Spirit our advocate -- to purify our intentions, and our motives for doing the work we do. When we're busy serving others. Once more. To God be the glory! All glory, thanks-giving, and all praise to the Lord our God! Nawa ang Panginoon'g Diyos natin, ang Siyang pasalamatan, ang Diyos ang purihin natin, at ating dakilain mula sa ating mga salita, at gawain. Salamat po.
