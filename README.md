- 👋  Hello there, how are you doing today? My name is Abraham, or Abe ('/Ah-beh/') to everybody.
- 💻  I’m a Filipino Web Analyst (on the side, a learner also, of stuff around the Cloud space. In particular, I'm gradually learning the practice of Cloud-enabled DevOps engineering. For me, I do aspire to become an engineer). Slowly, I'm growing relevant skills in order to help solve some technical problems. And in the process help support for a sustained growth of responsible organizations. For me, I like most home-cooked foods (I love food & beverage). More often than not, I watch goofy doggo videos online (and sometimes, also a few catto vids put in there, too). :D
- 🌱  Abe is committed to keep learning & to gradually but continually up-skill around Web Analytics (GA/GTM) & a few other adjacent areas of the Cloud -- like DevOps engineering (he's able to set up & maintain reliable infra, run a Continuous Integration/Deployment workflow, etcetera).
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find meaningful work to help me gain security, and also, in order to collaborate with others to do some good with Technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email & send it thru: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Thank you.
