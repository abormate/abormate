- 👋  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to acquaintances, and family.
- 💻  I’m an aspiring Filipino engineer, with a background in Web Analytics and Organic Search Marketing. Presently, I'm still growing relevant skills & gathering knowledge in order for me to help deliver value for folks who give me a chance. And this means, to be able to help solve some small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. A warm mug of coffee (with no sugar, and some whole milk) early in the morning, and a hearty breakfast sounds very good. More often than not, I watch goofy doggo videos online (sometimes, a few chonky catto videos put in there, too). ^_^ Who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh? Mostly I help around the house where I can, especially when it comes to family. Unlike when I was much younger, I don't play much videogames anymore. I'm fascinated with multi-purpose programming (but I'm not on any advanced stage at this time), I like learning about machines in general -- like your typical maintenance for a small gasoline car engine, and finally, I do leisurely play an acoustic guitar if time permits. 
- 🌱  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around specific areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this task with reliability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology. Working together, with tech as our democratized enabler, I think we can, again: if we work together, build and create a brighter tomorrow.
- 📫  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please, no spam, okay? Thank you!
