- üëã  Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, or you can call me, kuya (meaning older brother in Filipino) Abe (/'ah-beh'/) (kuya Abe) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family at home.
- üíª  Folks, brothers and sisters -- in terms of what I call recent I.T. experience, and maturity of skills within this space -- I'm an early-intermediate Filipino engineer. With this, I'm embracing continual learning in order to grow, as I move forward. I'm actively searching for a job, and hopefully land a meaningful role as an engineer. Like you, and like our brothers and sisters who work in the technical field of I.T.. Like, and with them, I'm also on a mission: for me, my mission statement is to serve the Lord our God, through helping people (somehow, beyond the context of business) with what we're able to do with computers. Personally, I think computer I.T. needs to serve this purpose, in order to come full-circle. For our collective work to become fulfilling having a purpose, and meaningful in a good way. Personally, I want to work for a living while helping contribute to a good cause.
- ü™¥ For me, I have learned that it is best to simplify what we can simplify. Abstract away complexities, and build a simple, thoughtful, and workable solution (or set of solutions) for people. Help improve things with the right motives, and improve oneself as a person for the better. Friends, there's always much room for improvements. And I would like to share with you, that my mission statement is to help connect I.T. with doing good for people. Planning to do this through small technical contributions, done in collaboration with friends, and with co-workers inside the workplace -- or, outside it. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And, I do say this with gratitude, I'm now working the kind of job that I have imagined myself doing from a much younger age.
- üõ£Ô∏è Friends, our technical journey must continue with embracing continual education and training. We must up-skill as we're working to earn a living. While, I have some helpful work experience as a web developer some time ago. And then followed with being given an opportunity to work as a technical web analyst. Like you or anyone else, I still need to continually train, study, and learn in order to grow helpful skills. This, in order to remain relevant in an ever-changing job market and tech landscape. While having also a desire to become helpful to others. We need to expand our know-how, regardless what field of I.T., if we are to grow enough to become helpful to other people.
- ‚õ™ Apart from what I help do to earn a living. I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, my friends, a lifetime of trying won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. Brothers and sisters, we need God in all things in life, and beyond it. We need His blessing in everything we do and say. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and God's constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. üïäüêë
- üíûÔ∏è If you're someone who's looking to hire an additional member to your team. I‚Äôm looking to find stable, but meaningful work in I.T.. This, to grow a technical career, make some good friends, and stay inside an organization long-enough for my own livelihood, for my family, and also, so that I can do something to help people through our work.
- üì´ Friends, if you need to talk to me. Please reach out via email, with this address: --> 'kuya-abe' + @ + 'server-mechanic.cloud'. You could also reach out to me from LinkedIn. Thank you!
- üåÖ We give all the glory to God -- we ought to honor God with what it is we do, my friends, and with what it is we say. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, with our actions, and our accomplishments. I think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving the Lord our God. And from what I have learned, serving God directly means loving and helping other people. Which begins at home -- with our families and then to our friends and so on -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute. And, just as a gentle reminder for everyone, helping others need NOT involve money. It could be anything good that God gave us -- like our time for family or friends, our skills to help build something good, our encouragement to someone who is down, and things like simply listening to someone troubled for example. And offering consolation -- giving pieces of practical, actionable, and ethically-sound advise to a brother or a sister. Let us choose to become part of the healing salve of God.
- ü§≤üèº My brothers and sisters, one final note, let us check ourselves -- and always ask God to purify our intentions, and our motives for doing our work, and when we're helping others. To God be all the glory! Glory and praise to the Lord our God! That in all things, may God be glorified!
