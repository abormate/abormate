- üëã  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing, friends? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and at home with family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm an aspiring Filipino engineer, with a background in Web Analytics and Organic Search Marketing. Along with what I do to earn a living, I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, a lifetime won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. We'll need God in all things. Apart from the Lord's mercy and help, we are helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help.
- Presently, I'm still growing technical skills & gathering relevant knowledge in order for me to help deliver value to folks who chose to give me a chance. And this means, to be able to help solve small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. A mug of coffee (mostly I like brewed coffee from locally-grown beans with some coffee-creamer, or whole milk. Not piping hot, not cold either -- but warm -- without any sugar), and a hearty breakfast early in the morning -- sounds very good to me.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy but goodest doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, chonky catto videos put in there, too). Now, who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh? ^_^ Anyway, I do like doggos and we've mostly had doggos as good pets and family members at home.
- No. Sorry, I don't play much videogames anymore. Unlike when I was much younger. Now I mostly just listen to a mix of videogame music soundtrack along with other types of music as I work or study. I'm fascinated with wide-purpose computer programming (please note -- I'm not an expert coder -- but I do know how to write simple logic with code in order to solve problems, or help build simple solutions -- once again, nothing over the top -- I still need to do a lot of skills improvement).
- Learning doesn't stop. Regardless what field your line of work happens to revolve in. I think no matter what kind of job we do for a living -- we'll need to embrace continual learning and somehow find a way to learn further. It need not be abrupt or all of a sudden. Proper and effective learning takes time and patience. With this said, good books and online courses with hands-on practice are your bestfriends, in this constant requirement for learning. Right now, I'm also still learning. Arguably, I think the requirement for us to learn never stops.
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around some areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please no spam, okay? Thanks! Gracias! Salamat po!
- My friends, we give the glory to God. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. For friends, it is only right for us to do so. I do believe in God. And I think we are alive for the purpose to serve God, through helping other people with what we're able to contribute. For me, this means helping our own family, our loved-ones, and also other people we meet in our journey. (We need to help others -- with the right heart and intent).
- Glory and praise to God. Long live, Jesus Christ our Lord, our great Teacher, and Redeemer, and our King!
