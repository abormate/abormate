- üëã  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to acquaintances, and family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm an aspiring Filipino engineer, with a background in Web Analytics and Organic Search Marketing. Presently, I'm still growing relevant skills & gathering knowledge in order for me to help deliver value for folks who give me a chance. And this means, to be able to help solve some small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. A warm mug of coffee (with no sugar, and milk, or some coffee creamer), and a hearty breakfast early in the morning -- sounds very good to me also.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, a few chonky catto videos put in there, too). ^_^ Now, who doesn't like circular, literally round cats, eh? Sorry, I don't play much videogames anymore. Unlike when I was much younger. I'm fascinated with programming (but I'm not on an expert stage at this time), learning about machines in general also piques my interest. Like around typical maintenance steps, that non-pros like me, could still do on a small gasoline engine. Finally, leisurely playing an acoustic guitar if time permits -- is relaxing to me. Nothing much when it comes to a guitar, mostly I find tablatures on the web to follow -- or, just strum along chord progressions that I could remember. 
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around specific areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this task with reliability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology. Working together, with tech as our democratized enabler, I think we can, again: if we work together, build and create a brighter tomorrow.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please, no spam, okay? Thank you!
