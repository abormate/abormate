- 👋  Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, or, Abe (/'ah-beh'/) to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family at home.
- 💻  I’m a mid-level, early-intermediate Filipino engineer, who works a living for a well-meaning organization on a good mission. I want to help connect I.T. with doing some good while I'm around. Through small technical contributions done in collaboration inside the workplace, or outside it. 👷‍♂️ And, I do say with gratitude, I'm now working the kind of job that I imagined myself doing from a much younger age. With this said, I'm not out of the woods just yet. My technical journey must continue with embracing continual training in order for me to become helpful. While, I have some experience as a web developer some time ago. And then, working as a technical web analyst. With a focus on setting up web tracking to collect needed metrics and put those in a report that makes sense. I still need to grow skills and expand my knowledge inside the field of I.T. proper that I want to grow from.
- ⛪ Apart from what I help do to earn a living, I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, a lifetime won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. We need God in all things. We need His blessing in everything. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. 🕊🐑
- 🪴  Learner Abe is committed to learning. Gradually but continually, he up-skills with study when able, hands-on practice, and training. Mostly, he's learning about a few areas of cloud computing. Particularly, with software delivery and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for people.
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find stable but meaningful work in I.T. to grow a technical career. And help me gain security: to help family members, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to become helpful somehow. Aligned with this, my friends, speaking the truth -- I really can't do any mission statement alone -- it's often and always with a like-minded, and a cohesive team working together -- helping each other to reach shared goals. It is through the collective effort of a team, with God's blessings and His continual guidance, that we're able to achieve anything. We all win, yes each one of us, wins, if we work together at helping other people.
- 📫  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please I do say this -- no spam, okay? Thanks! Much appreciated.
- 🌅 And also, my friends, we give the glory to God, with what it is we do. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. I also think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving God. And from what I have learnt, we can do this -- through loving and helping other people, which begins at home -- with our own families -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute.
- 🤲🏼 Let us ask God to purify our intentions in our work & when we're helping others. To God be all the glory! Glory and praise to the Lord our God!
