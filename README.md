- üëã  Hi there! Hello! How are you all doing, my friends? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and at home with family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm an aspiring Filipino engineer üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, mostly a beginner with some experience in the past as a web developer. More recently, I do have a skill-set in Web Analytics. And apart from what I help do to earn a living, I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, a lifetime won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. We need God in all things. We need His blessing in everything. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. üêëüïä
- Presently, I'm still growing some technical skills & learning relevant knowledge in order for me to help deliver value to folks who chose to give me a chance. And for me this means, to be able to help people we serve through working together to solve technical problems.
- For me, I love food and drink. A mug of coffee (I like freshly-brewed coffee, from locally-grown coffee beans, with some coffee-creamer or whole milk added to it. Not piping hot, and not cold either -- but warm -- also, without any sugar). A mug of warm coffee, and a hearty breakfast in the morning -- sounds good to me.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy but goodest doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, chonky catto videos put in there, too). Now, who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh? ^_^ Anyway, I do like doggos and we've mostly had doggos as good pets and family members at home.
- Learning as a requirement for anyone, is endless. Regardless what field your line of work happens to revolve in. I think no matter what kind of job we do for a living -- we'll need to embrace continual learning and somehow find a way to learn further. It need not be abrupt or all of a sudden. Proper and effective learning takes time and patience. With this said, good books and online courses with hands-on practice are your bestfriends, in this constant requirement for learning.
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around some areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please no spam, okay? Salamat! Thank you.
- My friends, we give the glory to God, thru what it is we do. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. I also think we are alive for a purpose to serve God, through helping other people with what we're able to contribute. I believe this means helping our family, our loved-ones, and also other people we meet in our journey. (We need to help others -- with what we can do or give, with the right heart and intent).
- Let us ask God to purify our intentions in our work & when we're helping others. To God be the glory. Glory and praise to God.
