- 👋  Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, or, most folks call me, Abe (/'ah-beh'/) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family at home.
- 💻  I’m an early mid-seniority, mostly low-level, and early-intermediate Filipino engineer. Who works a living for a well-meaning organization on a good mission. I want to simplify what I can simplify and improve for the better. For me, my mission statement is to help connect I.T. with doing some good, while I'm still around. Doing so, through small technical contributions done in collaboration with friends inside a workplace, or outside it. 👷‍♂️ And, I do say with gratitude, I'm now working the kind of job that I imagined myself doing from a much younger age.
- 🛣️ Friends, our technical journey must continue with embracing continual education and training. We must up-skill as we're working to earn a living. And while, I have some experience as a web developer some time ago. And then, being given an opportunity to work as a technical web analyst. Like you, or anybody, I also still need to grow my skills and cultivate my knowledge inside this field of I.T..
- ⛪ And apart from what I help do to earn a living. I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, my friends, a lifetime of trying won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. Brothers and sisters, we need God in all things in life, and beyond it. We need His blessing in everything we do and say. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and God's constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. 🕊🐑
- 🪴  Learner Abe is committed to learning. Gradually but continually, he up-skills with study, hands-on practice with small projects, and training. He's learning about software delivery, maintaining infrastructure, and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to be part of helping connect I.T. with helping people.
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find stable but meaningful work in I.T. to grow a technical career. And help me gain security: to help family members, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to become helpful somehow. Aligned with this, my friends, speaking the truth -- I really can't do any mission statement alone -- it's often and always with a like-minded, and a cohesive team working together -- helping each other to reach shared goals. It is through the collective effort of a team, with God's blessings and His continual guidance, that we're able to achieve anything. We all win, yes each one of us, wins, if we work together at helping other people.
- 📫  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please I do say this -- no spam, okay? Thanks! Much appreciated.
- 🌅 And also, my friends, we give the glory to God, with what it is we do. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. I also think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving God. And from what I have learnt, we can do this -- through loving and helping other people, which begins at home -- with our own families -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute.
- 🤲🏼 Let us ask God to purify our intentions in our work & when we're helping others. To God be all the glory! Glory and praise to the Lord our God!
