-- üëã Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, you can call me kuya Abe (the Filipino word "kuya" directly means older brother in Filipino) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family.

-- üíª Folks, my brothers and sisters, please allow me to speak my mind -- I'm a Filipino engineer with work experience deploying apps through number of steps or checkpoints with automation built-in, taking care and provisioning infrastructure that allow apps to run, and a few other stuff. My friends, I still have room to grow. Like with any branch or field in our modern work or job market, there is always plenty of stuff to learn. With this, I'm embracing continual learning in order to grow and consequently to remain relevant in the job market. I'm working with my brothers and sisters to enable others with computer I.T.. And like my brothers and sisters who work in this space. I'm also on a mission. For me, my mission statement is to serve the Lord our God, through helping people we serve (somehow, we need to go beyond the context of doing it for business reasons) with what we're able to do with computers. Personally, I think computer I.T. needs to serve this purpose, in order to come full circle. Our collective work becomes fulfilling if it has a good purpose behind it, beyond serving oneself, and it grows in a good way -- if we work with the right heart helping others (and in some way, help reduce suffering, where able). My friends, like you, I want to work a living while helping contribute to a good cause.

-- üõ£Ô∏è Friends, as we are traveling our shared journey, as fellow-pilgrims on earth, as fellow servants, for us to keep growing, and, to remain capable-enough to help. We must embrace continual learning, self-education. We must find a way to up-skill ourselves, find teachers, while we're working to earn a living for ourselves, for our families and loved-ones.

-- üíûÔ∏è And if it happens, you're someone who's looking to hire more hands to your team. Friend, I‚Äôm looking to find livelihood with what I can help do. Something that, I hope creates good meaning. From out of service, to help and elevate other people around us.

-- üì´ Friends, if you need to talk to me. Please reach out and write me an email. Thanks!

-- üåÖ We give the glory to God -- we ought to give God the honor, the thanksgiving, and praise -- with what it is we do, and, with what it is we say. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, with our actions, and with our accomplishments in life. I think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving the Lord our God. And from what I have learned, serving God directly means loving and helping other people. Which I believe, begins inside our homes -- with our own families, and then to our friends, and so on going forward. And a gentle reminder for everyone, helping others need NOT always involve giving money, or even taking money. It could be anything good that God gave us -- like our time for family or for friends, our skills to help build something helpful to others, our words of encouragement to someone who is at rock-bottom, and things like simply listening to someone troubled. Offering consolation, giving pieces of practical, actionable, and ethically-sound advise to a brother or a sister can mean a world of difference to someone who feels alone, or who is in need of help. My friends, let us choose to become a part, no matter how small we are, let us become a part of the healing salve of God.

-- ü§≤üèº And one final note, let us check ourselves often. Remember, that the best way to change anything -- is not to force, or coerce other people to change their ways -- but, it is with looking inside ourselves, and changing what we can, that we are able to see changes. We change our old ways, for ourselves first and foremost, but we must also improve ourselves for all other people around us. Let us always ask God to purify our intentions, our motives for doing the kind of work we do, when we're serving people. To God be all the glory! All glory, thanks, and all praise to the Lord our God! That in all things, may God be glorified! Nawa ang Diyos ang siyang pasalamatan, purihin natin, at dakilain natin mula sa ating mga salita at mga gawain. Salamat.
