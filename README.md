- 👋  Hello there, I’m Abraham, or Abe ('/Ah-beh/') to all my friends and family members.
- 👀  I’m interested in further growing my skills to solve problems with code, a little on cooking simple home-cooked foods, and watching good & goofy doggo vids online (and sometimes cattos, also).
- 🌱  I’m currently learning more about Data Analytics, and Cloud Engineering (and a little around Infra, like how to do this with IaC).
- 💞️  I’m looking to find stable work, collaborate with others, and help do some good with Technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email thru: abe (dot) bormate (at) gmail (dot) com
