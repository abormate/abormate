- üëã  Hi there! Hello! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe to all my friends, to acquaintances, and family.
- üíª  I‚Äôm an aspiring Filipino engineer, with a background in Web Analytics and Organic Search Marketing. Presently, I'm still growing relevant skills & gathering knowledge in order for me to help deliver value for folks who give me a chance. And this means, to be able to help solve some small technical problems. For me, I love food and drink. A warm mug of coffee (not piping hot, but warm -- without sugar, please), and a hearty breakfast early in the morning -- sounds very good to me also.
- More often than not, watching a lot of goofy but goodest doggo doggo videos online (sometimes, chonky catto videos put in there, too). ^_^ Now, who doesn't like circular, almost literally round cats, eh?
- No. Sorry, I don't play much videogames. Unlike when I was much younger. I'm still fascinated with programming though (but I'm not an expert, by any means -- I know how to code, and can do a few things with code, but that's mostly it), I'm still learning. And with that -- learning about machines in general piques my interest. Like around your typical maintenance for a small gasoline engine, that non-pros like me, could still do. And finally, leisurely playing an acoustic guitar especially -- if time permits -- is relaxing to me. Not much when it comes to a guitar, mostly I find tablatures on the web, and I follow those tabs. Or, if not, just strumming along chord progressions that I could remember. 
- üå±  Learner Abe is committed to learning. He gradually but continually up-skills with study and training, around specific areas of Cloud computing. Particularly in areas that allow him to grow practical engineering skills in software delivery and balancing this task with reliability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for other people.
- üíûÔ∏è  For me, I‚Äôm looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, I do want to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology. Working together, with tech as our democratized enabler, I think we can, again: if we work together, build and create a brighter tomorrow.
- üì´  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please, no spam, okay? Thank you!
