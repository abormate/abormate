-- üëã Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, you can call me kuya Abe (the Filipino word "kuya" directly means older brother in Filipino) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family.

-- üíª Folks, my brothers and sisters, please allow me to speak my mind -- I'm a Filipino engineer with work experience deploying apps through number of steps or checkpoints with automation built-in, taking care and provisioning infrastructure that allow apps to run, and a few other stuff. My friends, I still have room to grow. Like with any branch or field in our modern work or job market, there is always plenty of stuff to learn. With this, I'm embracing continual learning in order to grow and consequently to remain relevant in the job market. I'm working with my brothers and sisters to enable others with computer I.T.. And like my brothers and sisters who work in this space. I'm also on a mission. For me, my mission statement is to serve the Lord our God, through helping people we serve (somehow, we need to go beyond the context of doing it for business reasons) with what we're able to do with computers. Personally, I think computer I.T. needs to serve this purpose, in order to come full circle. Our collective work becomes fulfilling if it has a good purpose behind it, beyond serving oneself, and it grows in a good way -- if we work with the right heart helping others (and in some way, help reduce suffering, where able). My friends, like you, I want to work a living while helping contribute to a good cause.

-- üõ£Ô∏è Friends, as we are traveling our shared journey, as fellow-pilgrims on earth, as fellow servants, for us to keep growing, and, to remain capable-enough to help. We must embrace continual learning, self-education. We must find a way to up-skill ourselves, find teachers, while we're working to earn a living for ourselves, for our families and loved-ones.

-- üíûÔ∏è And if it happens, you're someone who's looking to hire more hands to your team. Friend, I‚Äôm looking to find livelihood with what I can help do. Something that, I hope creates good meaning. From out of service, to help and elevate other people around us.

-- üì´ Friends, if you need to talk to me. Please reach out and write me an email. Thanks!

-- üåÖ My brothers and sisters, may we offer what we do, and what we say, to bring glory to the Lord our God. It is right. We ought to give God the honor, all thanks-giving, and praise -- with what it is we do, and, with what it is we say. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things. Remember, apart and without God. We are helpless. We cannot do anything on our own. May I speak? I think we are alive for our unifying purpose of loving and serving God. From what I have learned, serving God means loving and helping other people. Which begins inside our homes -- with our families, then to our friends, and then, so on going forward. My friends, let us choose to become a part, no matter how small we are, let us become a part of the healing salve of God.

-- ü§≤üèº Let us check ourselves often. The good Jesuits, call it "examen". A reflection, a conscious effort of looking inside ourselves. Remember, that the best way to change anything -- is not to force, or coerce other people to change their ways or their thinking -- but, it is with looking inside, changing what we can, improving what is inside, that we are able to see changes. We change our old ways, for ourselves, but we also need to improve ourselves for other people around us. Moreso, for the people we love around us. Yes? With this. Let us always ask the Lord our God, Christ Jesus our Lord and good Shepherd, and the Holy Spirit our advocate -- to purify our intentions, and our motives for doing the work we do. When we're busy serving others. Once more. To God be the glory! All glory, thanks-giving, and all praise to the Lord our God! Nawa ang Panginoon'g Diyos natin, ang Siyang pasalamatan, ang Diyos ang purihin natin, at ating dakilain mula sa ating mga salita, at gawain. Salamat po.
