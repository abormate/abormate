-- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. Hey! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, please call me kuya Abe ("kuya" is a Filipino word meaning older brother). I'm a Filipino tech worker, who has also come to embrace healing, prayer, and learning. Like you, and many others before us, I'm working to make a living for myself, for my family at home, and so that, through working together, and doing it with how God called each of us to serve -- we could help others, and elevate people around us, too. To God be the glory! All glory, thanks-giving, and all praise to the Lord our God! Nawa ang Panginoon'g Diyos natin, ang Siyang pasalamatan, ang Diyos ang purihin natin, at ating dakilain mula sa ating mga salita, at gawain. Salamat po.
