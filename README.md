- 👋  Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, or, most folks call me, Abe (/'ah-beh'/) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family at home.
- 💻  Folks, seniority wise, in terms of work echelon and maturity of skills -- mostly I'm an early-intermediate Filipino engineer. Who works a living for a well-meaning organization on a good mission. I want to simplify what I can simplify and improve for the better. For me, my mission statement is to help connect I.T. with doing some good, while I'm still around. Doing so, through small technical contributions done in collaboration with friends inside a workplace, or outside it. 👷‍♂️ And, I do say with gratitude, I'm now working the kind of job that I imagined myself doing from a much younger age.
- 🛣️ Friends, our technical journey must continue with embracing continual education and training. We must up-skill as we're working to earn a living. And while, I have some experience as a web developer some time ago. And then, being given an opportunity to work as a technical web analyst. Like you, or anybody, I also still need to grow my skills and cultivate my knowledge inside this field of I.T..
- ⛪ And apart from what I help do to earn a living. I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, my friends, a lifetime of trying won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. Brothers and sisters, we need God in all things in life, and beyond it. We need His blessing in everything we do and say. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and God's constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. 🕊🐑
- 🪴 Learner Abe is committed to learning. Gradually but continually, he up-skills with study, hands-on practice with small projects, and training. He's learning about software delivery, maintaining infrastructure, and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to be part of helping connect I.T. with helping people.
- 💞️ If you're someone who's looking to hire an additional member to your team. I’m looking to find stable, but meaningful work in I.T.. This, to grow a technical career, make some good friends, and stay inside an organization long-enough for my own livelihood, for my family, and also, so that I can do something to help people through our work.
- 📫 Friends, if you need to talk to me. Please write and send me an email, and kindly send it to: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please I do say this -- don't send spam. Thanks! Much appreciated.
- 🌅 We give all the glory to God -- with what it is we do, and with what it is we say. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and our accomplishments. I think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving the Lord our God. And from what I have learned, serving God directly means loving and helping other people. Which begins at home -- with our families and then to our friends and so on -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute. It need not be money that we ought to give -- it could be anything good that God gave us, like our time, our skills, and things like simply listening to someone troubled for example, and offering consolation and pieces of practical, and morally-sound advise.
- 🤲🏼 My brothers and sisters, one final note, let us ask God to purify our intentions and motives that we have going in our work, and especially, when we're helping others. To God be all the glory! Glory and praise to the Lord our God!
