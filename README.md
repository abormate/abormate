- 👋  Hello there, how are you doing? My name is Abraham, or Abe ('/Ah-beh/') to everybody.
- 💻  I’m a Filipino Web Analyst (on the side, a Junior Cloud DevOps engineer) from the Philippines. And I'm interested in growing relevant skills to help solve problems, and support the growth of responsible organizations. Sparingly, I cook simple dishes. I like most home-cooked foods (I love food & beverage). And more often, I love watching goofy (but good) doggo videos online (and sometimes, also a few catto vids put in there, too). :^D
- 🌱  I’m committed to keep learning & gradually but continually up-skill around Web Analytics & a few areas of Cloud Engineering (like how it is to set up & maintain reliable infra with code).
- 💞️  I’m looking to find stable, long-term work in order to collaborate with others. And help do some good with Technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email thru: "kuya-abraham" (at) "pm" (dot) "me"
