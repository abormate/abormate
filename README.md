- 👋  Hello there, I’m Abraham, or Abe ('/Ah-beh/') to all my friends, co-workers, and family members.
- 👀  I’m interested in growing my skills to help solve problems with code, sparingly I cook simple home-cooked foods, and often watch goofy doggo vids online (and sometimes cattos, also).
- 🌱  I’m learning further about Data Analytics, & Cloud engineering (like how to set up & maintain Infra).
- 💞️  I’m looking to find stable, long-term work, collaborate with others, and help do some good with Technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email thru: abe (dot) bormate (at) gmail (dot) com
