- 👋  Hello there, how are you doing? My name is Abraham, or Abe to all my friends, acquaintances, and family.
- 💻  I’m a Filipino Web Analyst and an engineering-aspirant, a learner. This code-repository is my classroom, a learn-space. Presently, I'm gradually growing some skills in order to deliver value and help solve some technical problems. For me, I like most home-cooked foods (I love food & beverage). Coffee in the morning, and breakfast, to me, sounds very good. And, more often than not, I watch goofy doggo videos online (and sometimes, also a few catto vids put in there, too). ^_^
- 🌱  Abe is committed to keep learning & gradually but continually to up-skill around Web Analytics & a few other adjacent areas of the Cloud computing -- particularly with some areas that allow himself to grow some practical engineering skills. He wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good.  
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find meaningful work to help me gain security, enable me to help family, and also, to collaborate with others in order to do some good with what we can do with technology. Working together, with tech as our democratized enabler, I think we can, together, build a good tomorrow.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email & send it thru: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Thank you.
