- üëã  Hi there. Hello! How are you? My name is Abraham, or you can call me, kuya (meaning older brother in Filipino) Abe (/'ah-beh'/) (kuya Abe) -- to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, with family.
- üíª  Folks, my brothers and sisters -- in terms of what I call maturity of skills within this vast space -- I'm an intermediate Filipino engineer. With this, I'm embracing continual learning in order to grow, as I move forward. I'm actively searching for work to contribute to a good cause (apart from needing work to earn a living). Like our other brothers and sisters who work in this space. I'm also on a mission. For me, my mission statement is to serve the Lord our God, through helping people we serve (somehow, to go beyond the context of doing it for business reasons) with what we're able to do with computers. Personally, I think computer I.T. needs to serve this purpose, in order to come full circle. Our collective work to becomes fulfilling if it has a purpose, beyond just serving oneself, and it grows in a good way -- if we work with the right heart. My friends, I want to work for a living while helping contribute to a good cause.
- ü™¥ Over time, with past lessons, I have learned that it is best to simplify what we can simplify. Abstract away complexities, and build a simple, thoughtful, and workable solution (or set of solutions) for people. Help improve things with the right motives, and improve oneself as a person for the better. Friends, there's always much room for improvements. Planning to do with small, gradual, but consistent technical contributions. Done in collaboration with friends, and with venerable co-workers inside a workplace -- or, outside of it. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
