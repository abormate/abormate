- 👋  Hello there, how are you doing? My name is Abraham, or Abe ('/Ah-beh/') to everybody.
- 👀  I’m a Filipino Web Analyst from the Philippines. And am interested in growing skills to help solve problems, and support responsible organizations. Sparingly, I cook some simple home-cooked foods, and more often watch goofy doggo videos online (and sometimes cattos, also). :D
- 🌱  I’m learning & studying about Data Analytics, & Cloud engineering (like how it is to set up & maintain Infra).
- 💞️  I’m looking to find stable, long-term work, collaborate with others, and help do some good with Technology.
- 📫  Need to speak with me? Please write me an email thru: abe (dot) bormate (at) gmail (dot) com
