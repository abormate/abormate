- 👋  Hi there! Hello, my friends! How are you doing? My name is Abraham, or, Abe (/'ah-beh'/) to all my friends, to new and old acquaintances, and also, at home with my family.
- 💻  I’m a rookie Filipino engineer working for a well-meaning organization. I'm aspiring to help others thru small technical contributions done in the workplace, or outside it. 👷‍♂️, Mostly, I'm still a neophyte into I.T. engineering proper -- however, and I say with gratitude, that now I'm training to become helpful. I have some background experience as a web developer in the past. And to also add, from the past few years, I worked as an analyst specializing in Web Analytics and tracking, before being given a chance to work and contribute as a rookie engineer.
- ⛪ Apart from what I help do to earn a living, I'm still working to become a practicing Catholic. I believe in God. For me, a lifetime won't be enough to grow enough to become what I could call a truly practicing Catholic. We need God in all things. We need His blessing in everything. And I now understand that taken apart from the Lord's mercy, graces, and constant help -- my friends, we are truly helpless. We constantly need God's mercy, guidance, and help. Especially, if we choose to become disciples of the good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus, the Christ. 🐑🕊
- 🪴  Learner Abe is committed to learning. Gradually but continually, he up-skills with study whenever able, hands-on practice, and training. Mostly, he's learning about a few areas of cloud computing. Particularly, with software delivery and balancing this with stability. Broadly speaking, he wants to help connect I.T. with helping do good for people.
- 💞️  For me, I’m looking to find stable but meaningful work to help me gain security: to help family, to provide for my own needs and wants, and also, to grow enough to become helpful. Aligned with this, my friends I really can't do this mission statement alone -- it's often always with a like-minded, and cohesive team working together -- and helping each other to reach meaningful goals. It is through the collective efforts of a well-meaning, and a supportive team, and only with God's blessings and guidance, that we're able to achieve anything. We all win together, if we work together.
- 📫  Friend, if you need to speak with me. Please write me an email and kindly send it across: "abraham" (at) "learnersjourney" (dot) "net". Please I do say, no spam, okay? Salamat! Thanks!
- 🌅 And also, my friends, we give the glory to God, with what it is we do. May the Lord our God be glorified in all things -- with our words, our actions, and accomplishments. I also think we are alive for a singular and unifying purpose of loving and serving God. And from what I have learnt, we can do this -- through loving and helping other people, which begins at home -- with our own families -- with what we're able to do, give, and contribute.
- 🤲🏼 Let us ask God to purify our intentions in our work & when we're helping others. To God be all the glory! Glory and praise to the Lord our God!
